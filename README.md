# This is not the project you want
_TODO(jonas): ....._

I spent ~2 hours trying to make ChatGPT write this for me. It came close but no
cigar, threw this project together in 30 minutes. Actually somewhat useful so
might revisit and clean up; but ... prematurely publicizing just so that I can
easily share it to a couple of folks..
